\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There is a lot to say about the relationship between data and time. **Data Timeliness** is defined by [@Nousak:2002tb] as \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91The data element represents the most current information resulting from the output of a business event\u8217\'92, while expressed by [@Batini:2009u4] as \u8216\'91how current data are for the task at hand\u8217\'92. [@Batini:2009u4] also defines **data volatility**, characterising \u8216\'91the frequency with which data vary in time\u8217\'92. We take the stance that all there is to know about data and time is about their relationship: is the concept that the data instantiates considered a perdurant (i.e., happening in time) or an endurant (i.e., being in time), and, in case of the former, what is the precise moment that that precise state of affairs occurred. All the rest can be deferred from that ^[leuk bedacht, Brandt, maar de volatility kun je dus niet vaststellen, want je weet nooit of het het meest current data sample is], as long as the moment in time is considered a datum in itself with its own specific data quality, e.g., accuracy.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Time of occurrence is relevant for semantics of perdurants, at least to establish the order of events, whether that specific SoA is relevant or useless because they are too late or exactly a later or earlier one instead. Endurants do not have such implicit relationship with time, hence time of occurrence is irrelevant for their semantics.}}
