\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 **Term overloading** [@Janowicz:2012tk] is a very well known issue, e.g., a bank represents both a financial institute and the side of a river, or, a *large scale* study includes a *large* number of elements under survey, whilst a geographic map with *large scale* covers a *small* area since the scale represents a fraction. There are far more things in the world than we have terms for, therefore it is considered a necessary feature for sIOP to facilitate the means to identify and resolve term overloading ^[Term overloading is something different than Concept overloading since the former identifies variability due to overloading the semiotic Representamen with multiple Objects, while the latter only overloads the Interpretants with multiple Objects]. }
