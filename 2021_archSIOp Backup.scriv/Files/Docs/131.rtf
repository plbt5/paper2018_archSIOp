\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 **Semantic intelligibility** refers to have, as a recipient, sufficient prior knowledge about the world that the model addresses. Without overlap, at least a partial one, between the reality that is considered by the recipient and the reality that the model is about, the model is deemed incomprehensible for the recipient. For example, if I state that my car is green, I cannot expect the recipient to begin to comprehend that statement if world knowledge about vehicles and colours is absent. Intelligibility is also used by [@Neuhaus:2013tD] to indicate that all intended users need to be able to understand the intended interpretation of the ontology elements (e.g., individuals, classes, relationships) that are relevant to their use case. This view relates to the prior knowledge about the meta-model of the model, i.e., to be able to recognise the foundations that the model is build upon: In the same example, the recipient cannot recognise the car as a bearer for the green colour if knowledge about qualities that inhere in an entity is absent. }}
