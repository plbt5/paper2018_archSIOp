\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 **Restriction-Based Heterogeneity** }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 is defined in [@RodriguesLopes2012] as different conceptualisations that find their root in how restrictions are applied to the source or the target ontology, or even to both ontologies. The authors acknowledge two different forms of restriction-based heterogeneity, i.e., *class restrictions* versus *subsumption restriction*. Class restrictions allow differences to occur between subclassing, e.g., class `Book` is a subclass of class `Product`, at the one hand, and identification of a restriction on a property, e.g., `type = \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93book\u8221\'94` of a class `Publication`, at the other hand. }}
