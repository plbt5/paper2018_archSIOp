\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 **Data Accuracy** is defined by [@Nousak:2002tb] as \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Data element values are properly assigned\u8221\'94. For semantic purposes we would like to refine this and refer to the extent that the concept space has been mapped correctly to the reference space, as indicated by [@Probst:2008hs]. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A region in the semantic reference space, a *reference region*, serves to approximate an absolute magnitude in some concept dimension. Such reference region is denoted by a term, i.e., the datum. Using this terminology we define the data accuracy as the extent that the datum denotes that specific reference region that approximates the absolute magnitude in question. Note that since the approximation and the denotation is defined by convention, accuracy therefore holds under conventional rules.}
