Purpose of this section:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Explain sIOP:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item the consequence of data exchange = breaking the atomic semantic monolith = breaking the coherence between data and code, i.e., data leaving this monolith is the root cause of current sIOP problems;
    \item receiving external data implies a new reciprocity to emerge with the code of the receiving agent, and 
    \item sIOP demands that the external data shall be brought into coherence with the code of the receiving agent; without coherence, phantom semantics will emerge.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item sIOP objectives:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item prime objective is to assure that, from the perspective of the receiving agent and after receipt of data, the reciprocity between data and code remain truthful to the state of affairs in reality. This relates to both the external data and the data that can be inferred from them;
    \item allow for heterogeneity: since distinct agents will maintain alternative but equally legitimate points of view on reality, semantic heterogeneity is a feature to preserve necessarily;
    \item maintain loose coupling between both agents: the ASM's from both agents shall remain independent from each other;
    \item (allow for maintainability and semantic evolution)
    \item strive for access-and-play sIOP: ideally, sIOP between agents can be achieved instantaneously, also for unforeseen collaborations
  \end{enumerate}
  \item approach to sIOP:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Alignments: 
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
