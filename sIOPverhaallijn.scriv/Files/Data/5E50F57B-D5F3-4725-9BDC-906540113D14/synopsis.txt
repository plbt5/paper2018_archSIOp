The coordination and control of business interactions that apply in the context of a particular business conversation. must either be encapsulated by the software agent or assumed as an infrastructural mediated service, preferring the latter. Both solutions should instantiate a an interaction coordination session at the start of a business conversation, configured either by a business choreography, a business orchestration or a business conversation specification. The session ends at achieving the projected SoA. The session is to maintain a cache of the SoAs that apply as they occur or change. Semantics and Interaction are assumed to remain stable over a single session, but can change between sessions.
