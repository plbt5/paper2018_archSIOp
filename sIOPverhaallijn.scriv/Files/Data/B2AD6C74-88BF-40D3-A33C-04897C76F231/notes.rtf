\f0\fs24 \cf0 An agent\'92s individual contribution is their telic behaviour. According to the maxim, the occurrence of telic behaviour, or more precisely the SoA that results from it, must be timed carefully in order to be appropriate to the immediate needs of another agent. This implies a coordination of some sort, omnipotent on the relevant agents, their telic capabilities and how the success of the business conversation depends on them. Consequentially, a successful business collaboration can only emerge as the result of inter-agent coordination of their telic behaviour.  }
