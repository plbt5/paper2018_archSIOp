The agent should provide the capability to respond to a semantic protocol that has the objective to prepare sIOP. First, agents must reach agreement whether the required level of semantic compatibility can be achieved, and how. Second, agents must establish agreements on the [vocabularies and ontologies | domain models] in use. Third, agreement must be reached about how they relate semantically to each other; this might include engaging in a reconciliation process (van Diggelen, 2007), and/or application of pre-determined alignments between them.
