In our sIOP interpretation of Maxim 3 (Relation), it demands that agents need to communicate purposefully, relevant to the actual situation.

We distinguish at least different levels in agent comprehension:

* Comprehension about the communication protocols in order to engage in data exchange;
* Comprehension about the semantic protocols in order to engage in exchanging semantic meaning;
* Comprehension about the business collaboration in order to enable agent coordination towards the shared objective.

Apart from these levels in comprehension, two main distinctions in the domain of discourse exist:

* Discourse in terms of the core of the domain, viz the SoAs that apply in the DoA;
* Discourse *about* the DoA, viz the meta-domain:
    * provenance of the domain things, e.g., when and where did it originate, why was it registered (privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA) and when and by whom was it modified / addressed;
    * reliability of the statements made about the domain;
    * authorisation about the SoA that apply, i.e., who what authorised to access what SoA, by whom and on the bases of what criteria;
    * administration involved with the domain, e.g., required certificates or regulatory demands;
    * and many more
 
From an agent communication perspective, these meta-domains can be considered domains of their own since the discourse will address a particular meta-domain purpose to achieve. In such discourse, SoAs that apply in the core domain are simple facts that are plugged as object clause into the meta-domain discourse. These meta-domains require vocabularies of their own which can be defined, or have been already; PROV-O being an perfect example. This requires agents to ask or answer questions about the purpose of the interaction with any other agent. 

\begin{mmconcern}[Conversation purpose concern]\label{cncrn:rmc}
An agent needs to have the capability to engage in a meta-conversation -with one or more collaborating agents- with the single purpose to establish agreement on what to achieve with the conversation that they engage in. This capability can be considered a very fundamental capability when we consider the many different situations a group of agents can encounter, each requiring their own capabilities.
\end{mmconcern}

Applied DPs:

* DP X: Pragmatic protocol principle

So what? Based on this capability, any agent can engage in a conversation -on behalf of a stakeholder- with any other agent and:

* requests to engage in a conversation to establish a particular purpose;
* establish what it takes to establish that purpose
* achieve that purpose, providing the conditions are satisfied
