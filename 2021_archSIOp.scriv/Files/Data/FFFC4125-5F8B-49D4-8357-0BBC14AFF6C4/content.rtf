\pard\plain \ql\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A limited **language expressivity** [@Wand:1993dX] results in incomplete models, i.e., there exist phenomena in the considered domain that cannot be represented in the model. A language `L` is considered **complete** w.r.t. to a domain `D` iff every concept in the ontology `O` of that domain is represented in a modeling primitive of that language, e.g., if every concept in a domain conceptualisation is covered by at least one modeling construct of the language [@Guizzardi:2005tn]. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In order to compensate for limited language expressivity, users of the language can choose to overload an existing construct in order to represent concepts that originally could not be represented, thus, undermining clarity. Hence, unless some existing construct is overloaded, an incomplete modeling language is bound to produce incomplete models. However, the converse is not true, i.e., a complete modeling language can still be used to produce incomplete models.}
