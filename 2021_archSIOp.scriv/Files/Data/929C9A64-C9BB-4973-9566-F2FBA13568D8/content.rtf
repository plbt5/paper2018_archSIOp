These criteria compare the worldview underlying a language (it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s meta-model) with a representation of the specific domain conceptualisation that it represents. According to (ibid.) both criteria depend on the level of homomorphism between the meta-model and the conceptualisation. A low homomorphism provides room for misinterpretations and hence low sIOP. Homomorphism is dependent on each one of the following characteristics.}
