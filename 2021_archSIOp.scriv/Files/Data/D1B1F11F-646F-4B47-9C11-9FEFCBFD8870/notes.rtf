\f0\fs24 \cf0 We defend this disposition by considering the semiotic explanation on human communication that involves, besides the semantic decoding according to a shared code model, also an inference process that starts from a set of premises and results in a set of conclusions that are warranted by them [@Grice:1991BT; Sperber1995]. The inference model that is used by the process is in contrast to the code model, not mutually shared.}
