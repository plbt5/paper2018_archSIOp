\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The incorrect weight of the patient was entered on admission as 40 kg. The patient actually weighs 40 *pounds*. The patient\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s medication dose was calculated based on the patient\u8217\'92s weight in kilogrammes. Pharmacy caught the error and corrected the dose based on the patient\u8217\'92s true weight. The individual entering the data may have thought the patient\u8217\'92s weight was entered in pounds, but the computer stored the information as kilogrammes. Without the pharmacist\u8217\'92s intervention, the patient, a child, would have received a medication dose intended for a person more than two times the patient\u8217\'92s actual weight. }
