\f0\fs24 \cf0 The authors of [@Neiva2016] present a literature research to pragmatic interoperability. Although no definition on pragmatics or its interoperability is given, the distinction with semantics is given as \'93semantics is related with which the [semiotic] sign refers to, and pragmatics is related to the effect of the sign on the interpreter.\'94. This aligns with our application of semantic meaning and pragmatic meaning. Where the authors keep pragmatics separate from semantics and, therefore, treat pragmatic interoperability separate from semantic interoperability, we consider the reciprocity between them significant and conclude that semantic interoperability can only be achieved when the DSC can re-establish the connection of the DSP\'92s data with its own pragmatic meaning. Opposed to the authors opinion, we consider the pragmatic meaning a necessary element in achieving sIOP.}
