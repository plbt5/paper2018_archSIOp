\f0\fs24 \cf0 Since we here talk about *semantic* interoperability, we first need to establish what is meant with semantics in software. We then defend the need for semantic heterogeneity and contrast that with the current approach to achieve sIOP through standards defining semantic homogeneity. The last subsection surfaces semantic concerns that follow from the responsibilities that apply between communicating agents. First we describe a motivating example.}
