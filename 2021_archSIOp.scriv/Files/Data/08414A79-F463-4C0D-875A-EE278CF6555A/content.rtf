\f0\fs24 \cf0 In the previous sections we\'92ve identified the need for agents to exchange semantic meaning in their own, local representation of their private conceptualisation that only applies their locally adopted background knowledge. We have identified several semantic reconciliation concerns and introduced alignments to their resolution, and established the need for semantic scalability. We first identify the mediation concern, then introduce the mediation pattern and show how to apply that in the semantic setting to alleviate the mediation concern.}
