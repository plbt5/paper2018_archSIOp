\f0\fs24 \cf0 Current sIOP practises already require human effort to reconcile the semantic differences that occur. In these cases, the subject of reconciliation is differences in data schemata, and the result of the reconciliation is laid down as a canonical data model. This enforces the conflation of semantics with syntax. In contrast, the semantic meaning of the agents\'92 DMs allows semantic reconciliation to apply on the conceptual level. Consequently, the dependency of semantics on the (data) syntax, and vice-versa, is minimised. We have shown in [the FIT4Ontologies project] that having a domain ontology available results in a more clear and efficient process to define the data messages that are to be exchanged between stakeholders, in comparison to creating the canonical data model. Part of this efficiency was gained by having available an explicit account of the semantics by means of a domain ontology, the other part was gained by the tool that was available that allowed ontological constructs to direct the construction of the data messages. Indeed, the reconciliation that we propose already makes use of the involved semantic meanings, expressed as ontologies, from the DSP and DSC DMs. However, adding even more semantic information in the reconciliation process, such as previously established alignments or shared vocabularies, if available, to direct the reconciliation process, will result in a further reduction of the human effort. Availability of computer-assisted reconciliation tools will reduce the human involvement, see next paragraph. Such approaches bring about two major advantages over existing sIOP practices that rely on canonical data models: First, it accelerates the deployment of sIOP by removing all human effort that is concerned with deployment and implementation activities concerned with wrapping data exchange components; second, due to decoupling semantics from syntax, i.e., separating the sIOP concern from the data communication concern, problems are better scoped and agreements are easier to achieve. We further propose to scope the reconciliation to bilateral alignments only, because this represents the atomic and, hence, most simple semantic gap to overcome, from which more complicated multi-lateral alignments can be produced, mechanically. Indeed, such bilateral approach raises concerns about scalability, which we will deal with in \\cref\{engineering-semantic-scalability,roadway-mediation-concerns\}. This process has been depicted in \\cref\{fig:dt-reconciliation\}.\

![Semantic reconciliation results in an alignment between the semantic representations of two ontologies. We defend that semantic reconciliation is a computer-aided but ultimately human-authored task.][def:DTReconciliation]\
\
The current limits of machines, which follow from their token-based foundation, prevents to discharge the human from the responsibility to reconcile semantic differences and to lay these down in an alignment. That does not imply absence of computer assistance in this task. Much research has been conducted in the mechanisation of the so-called ontology reconciliation problem, conveniently summarised by [@Euzenat:2013ie]. Since then, additional research has been conducted, [@Shvaiko2020] and many others[^{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://OM.org"}}{\fldrslt OM.org}}], resulting in many tools in its support[^ORT]. However, mechanical ontology reconciliation and generation of ontology alignment, remains a bridge too far for now. Still, these tools show an indispensable aid in the semantic reconciliation process, and at the same time define the role of the inevitable human in the loop more as an auditor than as an author of the alignment. Also, more collaborative approach es have been developed as well, e.g., [@Xue2017]. Still, these technologies can never guarantee semantic completeness and correctness of the resulting alignments. Human efficiency in realising their responsibility can therefore be improved by tools that reduce the human effort to only (i) performing a semantic audit on the established semantic alignment, and (ii) authoring necessary changes in the semantic alignment. Having said that, the operational syntactical transcription that follows from the semantic alignment can remain generic and, hence, can potentially be pushed into the infrastructure, see \\cref\{roadway-mediation-concerns\}. \
\
We cannot formulate a design principle for this aspect (unless \\cref\{dp:cti\} might {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://80DACC50-0E99-461A-82D5-D71A1E30D77E"}}{\fldrslt suffice}}), but conclude that improving the efficiency with which the human responsibility can be achieved can be found in moving, to the extent possible, her role from an author to the auditor of alignments. To that end, we identified (i) applying semantic reconciliation on the bases of all available information, notably ontologies, already established alignments and shared vocabularies alike, (ii) maximising the use of reconciliation tools where possible, (iii) having these tools harness, to the maximal extent possible, the information from (i) as available, and (iv) following all DPs in this paper.  \
