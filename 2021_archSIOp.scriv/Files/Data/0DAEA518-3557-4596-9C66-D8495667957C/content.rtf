\f0\fs24 \cf0 Current sIOP}}
\f0\fs24  practises already require human effort to reconcile the semantic differences that occur. In these cases, the subject of reconciliation is differences in data schemata, and the result of the reconciliation is laid down as a canonical data model. This enforces the conflation of semantics with syntax. Contrarily, by applying semantic reconciliation on the conceptual level, the dependency on semantics on the (data) syntax, and vice-versa, is minimised. Moreover, by representing the result of the reconciliation as an alignment between ontologies \'97as opposed to a canonical model of the semantics, a.k.a. a domain or core ontology\'97 the influence of collaborating agent\'92s semantics on one\'92s own semantics via such domain ontology is minimised as well. An alignment, thus, functions as an interface that enforces loosely coupled semantics by enabling semantic transparency between communicating peers (further investigated in \\cref\{engineering-semantic-scalability\}). Further reduction of the human reconciliation effort can be achieved by computer-assisted reconciliation tools, by making use of previously established alignments, if available, and to maximise the human involvement to authoring an alignment only. Such approach bringst two major advantages over canonical data models: First, it accelerates the deployment of sIOP by removing all human effort that is concerned with deployment and implementation activities concerned with wrapping data exchange components; second, it decouples the sIOP scope to bilateral alignments only. This process has been depicted in \\cref\{fig:dt-reconciliation\}.\

![Semantic reconciliation results in an alignment between the semantic representations of two ontologies. We defend that semantic reconciliation is a computer-aided but ultimately human-authored task.][def:DTReconciliation]\
\
The current limits of machines, which follow from their token-based foundation, prevents to discharge the human from the responsibility to reconcile semantic differences and to lay these down in an alignment. That does not imply absence of computer assistance in this task. Much research has been conducted in the mechanisation of the so-called ontology reconciliation problem, conveniently summarised by [@Euzenat:2013ie]. Since then, additional research has been conducted, [@Shvaiko2020] and many others[^{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://OM.org"}}{\fldrslt OM.org}}], resulting in many tools in its support[^ORT]. However, ontology reconciliation and, hence, mechanical generation of ontology alignment, remains a bridge too far for now. Still, these tools show an indispensable aid in the semantic reconciliation process, and at the same time define the role of the inevitable human in the loop more as an auditor than as an author of the alignment. Also, more collaborative approach es have been developed as well, e.g., [@Xue2017]. Still, these technologies can never guarantee semantic completeness and correctness of the resulting alignments. Human efficiency in realising their responsibility can therefore be improved by tools that reduce the human effort to only (i) performing a semantic audit on the established semantic alignment, and (ii) authoring necessary changes in the semantic alignment. Having said that, the operational syntactical transcription that follows from the semantic alignment can remain generic and, hence, can potentially be pushed into the infrastructure, see \\cref\{roadway-mediation-concern\}. \
\
We cannot formulate a design principle for this aspect, but conclude that improving the efficiency with which the human responsibility can be achieved can be found in (i) applying semantic reconciliation on the highest conceptual level, directing the reconciliation at lower levels, (ii) maximising the use of reconciliation tools where possible, (iii) following all DPs in this paper, and (iv) applying a principled, maximal semantic separation of concerns.  \
