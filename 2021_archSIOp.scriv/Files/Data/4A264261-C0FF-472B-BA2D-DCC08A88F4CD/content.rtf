\pard\plain \ql\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 We have already determined that the principle to align semantics as opposed to data schemata, \\cref\{dp:ssoc\}, breaks the conflation of semantics and syntax, enabling to consider semantics on its own terms^[Pun not intended]. Abstaining from a canonical model by introducing a semantic alignment between pairs of semantic meanings, \\cref\{dp:alignment\} introduces the capability for each agent to develop its semantic representation in a way that fits its local perspective optimally. By also encapsulating the particular means to provide valid semantic transcriptions only and refrain from naive transcriptions between communicating agents, \\cref\{dp:mediation\}, the necessary elements to support semantic heterogeneity are present.}
