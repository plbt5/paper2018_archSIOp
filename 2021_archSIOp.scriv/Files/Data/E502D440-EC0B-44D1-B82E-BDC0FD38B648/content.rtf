\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A doctor ordered a change in the frequency of a neonate\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s antibiotic from every 12 hours to every 18 hours. The organisation\u8217\'92s protocol for a medication schedule change requires the patient\u8217\'92s nurse to enter schedule changes in the electronic medication administration record (eMAR) as indicated by routine care processes. After starting a new infusion for the infant near midnight, the nurse noted in the eMAR that the next infusion should be given at 3 p.m. the next day, which was a Tuesday. The nurse miscalculated the timing of the next dose, which should have been indicated for 6 p.m. the next day. Also, *because the information was entered near midnight*, the timing of the next dose was recorded as 3 p.m. for Wednesday, resulting in a longer interval than prescribed before the next antibiotic treatment. The nurse discovered and reported the dose omission at the start of the Wednesday afternoon shift. The infant was continuously monitored for signs of sepsis infection and, despite the dose omission, did not develop any bloodstream infection during the hospital stay. }
