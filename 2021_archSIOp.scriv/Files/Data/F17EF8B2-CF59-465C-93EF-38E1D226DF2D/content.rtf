\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Similarly to its definition on the level of `particulars`, we introduce **semantic provenance** on the level of `universals` as the derivation history of a semantic product starting from its original sources. Its purpose is to provide for traceability information about the semioses, e.g., the way that a specific `object` has been perceived, abstracted, and represented into its referring \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91representamen`. In this way, semantic provenance is an important information source about the semiotic history. This is close to, or encompasses, purpose of model and/or application. [@W3C:2013Xp] states that provenance is information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing in the world, which can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness.}}
