        <Text>In order to fully appreciate the results of our work, it is necessary to acknowledge the similarities and notably the differences between ontology and models. This is especially relevant since in contemporary architectural paradigms models are being used as first class citizens to the architectures, MDA and ISP RM/ODP alike. One could argue what the benefits are of the use of ontologies as opposed to models that are used to represent reality, i.e., the information viewpoint or the domain model.</Text>
