%%% About this LaTeX template: %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This template should work with any (reasonably recent) full
% installation of TeXLive or MikTeX. The "ecis2015" package loads a
% number of other packages, so if some package is missing, please
% install it using the package manager of your TeX distribution. In
% particular, if the "tikz" package is missing, you may have to install
% "pgf" or simply remove our example graphics (see figure example
% below).
%
% The file "ecis2015.sty" should be placed somewhere in your TeX Path
% (or simply in the same folder as your document).
%
% Please use PDFLaTeX to compile your document.
%
% You need not escape special characters or Umlauts like é ä ö ü ß (in 
% fact, you shouldn't), as this source is inputenc'd in UTF-8.
%
% Note for BibTeX users: We use BibLaTeX for formatting, so we use Biber
% as a sorting backend (default). 
% If you still need to use the old BibTeX program, please change the 
% BibLaTeX backend in the package file ("ecis2015.sty").

\begin{abstract}
On making use of a YAML-block, make this your very first document file
such that Scrivener will compile this document page as the very first
text in the resulting (generated) file. The template supports the use of
an abstract that is copied into the LaTeX \texttt{abstract} variable
that you can find the basic tex template.\\
You can use newlines, but remember this is a standard YAML-format, hence
use two spaces before the newline, and four spaces to begin your new
line as has been done with this line.

This is probably my first, and only, chapter in this document. This is
an MMD-format text: multi-markdown format, which is very easy to read
and write, and is remarkably expressive for encoding formats, e.g., a
list:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  with bullits
\item
  two lines of bullits;
\item
  no, three lines!
\end{itemize}

Note that you can find an MMD cheat sheet in the binder of this
Scrivener project. However, you do not need to make use of mmd;
Scrivener is also capable of some basic formatting so that you can use
it similar to what you are used in Word.
