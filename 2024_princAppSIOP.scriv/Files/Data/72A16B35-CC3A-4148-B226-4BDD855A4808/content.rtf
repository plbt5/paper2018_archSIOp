\f0\fs24 \cf0 Since we here talk about *semantic* interoperability and *semantic* concerns, we establish what is meant with real-world semantics (RWS) in software in the first subsection. We then defend the need to allow for what is called semantic heterogeneity and contrast that with the current approach to achieve sIOP through (syntactic) standards defining semantic homogeneity. The third subsection surfaces semantic concerns that follow from the responsibilities that apply between communicating agents. Finally, we consider the classical concern about loose coupling but in a semantic reading instead, in order to respond to consequences that follow from pursuing interoperability while insisting on a semantic heterogeneous environment. }
