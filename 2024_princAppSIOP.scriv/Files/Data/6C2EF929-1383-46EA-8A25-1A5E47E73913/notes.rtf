\f0\fs24 \cf0 Such semantic transparency is realised by a disconnect on the global (domain) level between data syntax and semantic meaning. Semantic transparency, thus, is a causal consequence from semantic heterogeneity, and together with semantic separation of concerns, an enabler for loosely coupled semantics. \
\
transparency between the domain semantics as applied by the business and how these domain semantics is being used by the agents acting on behalf of the business. As indicated in \\cref\{semantics-in-software\} points 8 & 9, only the DM is responsible for the semantics, whereas the SM is only semantically grounded in that DM. This implies that when operations from telic and other system behaviour address semantics, they must do so through semantic services provided by the DM. }
