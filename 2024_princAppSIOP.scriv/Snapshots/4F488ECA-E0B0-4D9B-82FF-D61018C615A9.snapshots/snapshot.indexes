        <Text>A correspondence specifies as accurately as possible the semantic relation that exists between a pair of concepts, in order to align between the semantic meanings of interoperating agents. By exhaustively addressing all semantic relations that exist between pair of concepts of both agents, the set of correspondences collectively specify the semantic alignment that holds between the semantic meanings that are intended by the data that are exchanged between the two agents. The purpose of the alignment is to specify how the truth-value of expressions that are formulated in terms of the DSP, can be established by using formulations in terms of the DSC. To that end, the alignment language must be expressive enough to represent the two categories of semantic differences identified above:

1. Conceptual differences: Assuming semantic compatibility, \cref{def:semantic-compatibility}, variations in semantic meaning do not root in the use of distinct ontological commitments, but from variations in how ontological principles apply under different perspectives, with different context and background knowledge, viz carving out reality in the particular way that fits the agent’s purpose. Representing the conceptual differences as correspondence relation requires to express (i) how to preserve the semantic meaning of what is referred to in the DoA, (ii) the real-world meta-properties of the relation, and (iii) how to constrain the possible interpretations of the semantic meaning into the intended ones [@Guizzardi2020]; 
1. Value space differences: variations in 
  1. applied conventions on representing a value in its value space, for values with or without magnitudes alike, e.g., differences in value scales, units of measure or nominal properties [@Probst:2008hs]. For these variations, the language should be capable of defining conversion algorithms to translate values from one representation into another without inducing invalid semantics;
  1. inherent characteristics of a value that result from the method of measurement or observation, and the measurement system applied. These are measurement-induced qualities that present themselves as accuracy, drift, calibration and more [@Anonymous:2008tY]. Only a one-directional translation from higher to lower quality is possible, implying a technological upgrade for the DSP when the DSC demands higher quality.

As opposed to conceptual differences and convention-induced value space differences, measurement-induced variations can only be identified but not resolved by any correspondence. In [@Euzenat2007;@Scharffe2011], the authors report on an investigation towards the requirements for a language to align ontologies, independent on the ontological content, resulting in EDOAL [@Scharffe2011]. This language clearly shows the distinct formalisations required between representations about ontological correspondences and those about convention-induced value transformations. This vital distinction is absent in, e.g., [@Dimou2014], that, admittedly is not designed with the purpose of specifying ontology alignments but for conversion between a wide variety of data formats and the RDF language, which is a clear example of syntax-only conversion.

In conclusion, by application of conceptual connectors, the architecture gains the capability to relate a specific compound of individuals in the DSP’s DM with those in the DSC’s DM, reconciling the above conceptual differences. Similarly, with the application of value transformation connectors, the architecture gains the capability to overcome the above convention-induced value differences. In our formulation of \cref{dp:alignment-language} to reflect the above.
