NOTE: The following is a dirty trick to force Scrivener's Compilation process to handle the synopsis equivalent to the Title, Meta-Data, Notes and Text parts:

--> Each synopsis should finish with particular LaTeX code (\end{synopsis}). Then, when you select those different parts to be included in the compilation (in Compile > Formatting), the Synopsis, Meta-Data and Notes will get different text formatting than the Text part.

\end{synopsis}
