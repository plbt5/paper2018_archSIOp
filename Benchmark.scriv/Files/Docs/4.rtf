Based on previous results with, particularly, the m-Jali program (both the software and the organisation), it became clear that a significant improvement of the health of the communities in Kenya can be achieved, providing (i) the availability of a purposeful organisation that incorporates the interest of all key stakeholders, and (ii) a flexible software product that adapts to available (mobile) technology and optimally facilitates the end-users in their task. In Figure \\ref\{}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 img:prevention-and-self-mgt\} it is shown how a more sustainable health care system can be provided by strengthening primary care to improve health, increase efficiency, and reduce costs.}
