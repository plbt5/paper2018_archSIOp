\pard\plain \ql\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The mediation pattern has already been described in [@Gamma1994], albeit in the context of object-orientation as opposed to sIOP. Still, the fundamentals of the pattern can also be applied in the subject context, promoting loose coupling at the semantic level between agents, and introducing a high level on independent variation in agents and their semantics and reuse of their semantic bridgehead and the generic semantic mediator. }
