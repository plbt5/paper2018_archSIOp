\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 **Semantic precision** is defined by [@Falbo:2005vt, @McComb:2003uF] to refer to the specificity with which the data has been meta-annotated to a specific level of discernment. We take the stance that it is not about meta-annotation but about the ability to discern between apparently similar concepts. Semantic precision can thus be viewed as the inverse of categorisation (refer to \\cref\{categorisation-variety\}) in that categorisation is about selecting concepts to fit a predefined set, while precision is about differentiating concepts to belong to different sets. }
