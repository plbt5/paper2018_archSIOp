\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 **Semantic granularity** [@Albertoni:2006va; @Fonseca:2002uv; @Keet:2008wa] represents the level of detail at which semantics have been defined, and summarises the degree of informativeness that results from both the issues that describe the concept and the structure or schema in which it is embedded. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The term **semantic accuracy**, coined by [@Nyberg:1992to], \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93characterises the completeness and correctness with which an entity in reality, once conceptualised and represented by a model, can be interpreted by the recipient\u8221\'94. The completeness of a drawing of a tree, for example, will be influenced by the ex- or inclusion of its roots and of its leafs, while its correctness might suffer from the artist\u8217\'92s drawing skills, or creative style, e.g., impressionism versus expressionism. In our opinion, correctness might be better termed *faithfulness*.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 We take the stance that where semantic granularity represents an indication of level of detail, semantic accuracy is about the criteria one sets on the grains itself. Difference in semantic granularity between communicating peers shows by details being absent, conceptual incompleteness (e.g., missing issues) or discrepancies in conceptual structures.}}
