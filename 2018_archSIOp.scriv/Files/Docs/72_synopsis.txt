Purpose of this section: present a list of differences, and notably, that formal semantics can to some extend take the role as conceptualisation
Refer , [@Henderson-Sellers2012]

Conclusions:
1 - ontologies are more appropriate artefacts for conceptual models than system models
2 - as in [@AÃŸmann2006]: "Specification models focus on the specification, control, and generation of systems; ontologies focus on description and conceptualization (conceptual modelling) of things. Both kinds of models have in common the qualities of abstraction and causal connection."
