Purpose of this section: present a list of differences.
Refer to [@Henderson-Sellers2012]

Conclusions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item ontologies are more appropriate artefacts for conceptual models than system models
\item as in [@AÃŸmann2006]: "Specification models focus on the specification, control, and generation of systems; ontologies focus on description and conceptualization (conceptual modelling) of things. Both kinds of models have in common the qualities of abstraction and causal connection."
\end{enumerate}
