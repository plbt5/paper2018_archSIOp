The pharmacist had to double-check the information with the provider: Pharmacy received an order to dispense an antibiotic and pain medication postoperatively for a patient in outpatient surgery. Both medications are contraindicated for patients with known allergies to the drugs. There was no allergy information for the patient entered into pharmacy system. The pharmacist consulted with outpatient surgery and verified the allergy information. The information about the patient\u8217\'92s allergies did not cross over from the electronic health record. }
