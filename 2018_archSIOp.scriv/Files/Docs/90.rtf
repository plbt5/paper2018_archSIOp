\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) warns that simply replacing insulin pens with insulin vials also has pitfalls. For staff who have been using insulin pens for any length of time, transitioning back to insulin vials may uncover knowledge deficits that may lead to errors and patient harm. Insulin vials are labelled differently from most other medications. A label of \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93U-100\u8221\'94 on a vial, for example, may be misunderstood to mean that there are 100 units of insulin in that vial, when in fact it means that the concentration of insulin in the vial is 100 units per mL; failure to recognise this fact could lead to a 10-fold overdose. }
