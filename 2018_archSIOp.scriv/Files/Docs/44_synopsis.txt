Purpose of this section: 

* Show the semantic architecture as an additional layer that is orthogonal to current layers, expressing a separation of concerns between syntax and semantics (see [@Brandt:2013jh])

* Define loosely coupled semantics as a result of applying the 2 principles 'semantic separation of concerns' and 'semantic transparency' (see [@Brandt:2013jh])

* Repeat the Coherence Principle, the sIOP Coherence Principle, and the Ontological Commitment Principle, and show how they fit in the semantic architecture
