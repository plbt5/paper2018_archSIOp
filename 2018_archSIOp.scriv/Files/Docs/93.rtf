\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Much to the surprise of Mission Control, the space shuttle Discovery flew upside-down over Maui on 19 June 1985 during an attempted test of a Star-Wars-type laser-beam missile defence experiment. The shuttle's laser reflecting mirror was supposed to be oriented pointing downward at a spot 10,023 feet above sea level on Mona Kea; that number was supplied to the crew in units of feet, and was correctly fed into the onboard guidance system -- which unfortunately was expecting units in nautical miles, not feet. Thus the mirror wound up being pointed (upward) to a spot 10,023 nautical miles above sea level. Not surprisingly, the experiment failed. }
