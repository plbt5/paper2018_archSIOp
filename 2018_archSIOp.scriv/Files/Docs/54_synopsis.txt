Explain sIOP:

    1. consequence of data exchange = breaking the reciprocity by partitioning the data from its original code, and 
    1. sIOP means that despite this partitioning the reciprocity between the code of the receiving agent and the external data has been maintained, and
    1. Phantom semantics (i.e., the difference in the original reciprocity and the new reciprocity) is the cause of sIOP failure and hence to be prevented at all costs.
