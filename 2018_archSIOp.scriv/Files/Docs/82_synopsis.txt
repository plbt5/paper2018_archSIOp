scalability by topology
\begin{itemize}
\item Clarify the use of the alignment and mediation approach as an atomic, peer-to-peer sIOP pattern.
\item Show how multiple agents can collaborate by cascading, or by introducing a core semantic specification, or by augmenting a centralised topology with a peer-2-peer topology
\end{itemize}
