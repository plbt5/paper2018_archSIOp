\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Consider an agent who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s local semantics are in demand for a change. Assume that the agent has modified its internal pragmatic meaning to accommodate the evolved semantics. This implies a change in what we called the semantic bridgehead, which acts as semantic interface to any sIOP concerns. The semantic change can be considered an altered or additional difference with the semantic bridgehead from interoperating peer agents. In order to not destroy the sIOP that had been established before, it is necessary to reflect the new difference as modifications to the alignments that apply. By having performed the necessary modifications, and by relying on the semantic validity of the own ontology, the mediator is now capable of transcribing the data in accordance to the evolved semantics.}}
