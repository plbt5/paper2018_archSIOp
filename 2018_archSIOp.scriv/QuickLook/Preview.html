<p class="itemText">*Background:* Access-and-Play semantic interoperability (sIOP) is the next glass ceiling in IT-based business collaboration. Current approaches towards sIOP rely on conventions on the semantics of the exchanged terms, which can be considered accepted folklore. Approaches to break through the ceiling require some level of automation, and artificial intelligence (AI) can make a difference.       </p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Introduction</p>
<p class="itemText">Never before, data were so ubiquitous, and managed access to external data was so easy. Because current ICT is unable to *use* all that same external, non-native data as access-and-play service, agility in business collaboration is hampered in all domains. For instance, consider the following (allegedly real) example of an interoperability failure.</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">The semiotic and philosophical foundations of semantics</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Ontological commitment</p>
<p class="itemText">Purpose of this section is to show the relevance of a (modelling) language: a language is used to convey distinctions. The distinctions that are aticulated by a language are denoted as its ontologcal commitment. Modelling languages need to show distinctions that are of relevance to the purpose of modelling. The predominant purpose of modelling is to describe (a particular domain in) reality by distinguishing the entities of interest. The ontological commitment for a modelling language therefore should be of ontological nature, “(...) not in order to know *what there is*, but in order to know what a given remark or doctrine, ours or someone else’s, *says* there is” [@Quine:1953er]. The ontological square or its extension into the ontological sextet [describe it] can be considered the most basic one, which have been specialized into several flavours, all called upper-level, or top-level, or foundational, ontologies, e.g., UFO, BFO, DOLCE and more. </p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Show how MDE/MDA applies an ontological commitment as defined in M3, which facilitates an equivalent distinction as the ontological square, but less than the ontol.sextet.</p>
<p class="itemText"> </p>
<p class="itemText">Optionally, provide for the distinctions/theories that are foundational to the two most appropriate ontological commitments / foundational ontologies: BFO and UFO.</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Bridgehead: Semantics</p>
<p class="itemText">Purpose of this section: </p>
<p class="itemText">\begin{enumerate}</p>
<p class="itemText">\item From a semiotic perspective, explain what we mean with semantics in software agents, i.e., the reciprocity between data and data processing code (both represented as Term from the semiotic Sign).</p>
<p class="itemText">\item Establish that for representing semantics, descriptive models (i.e., ontologies) trump prescriptive models (all 42010 models).</p>
<p class="itemText">\item Conclude that ontologies need their place as single point of reference (trueness) in architectures, and identify their relationship with the rest of the architectures, i.e., all other prescriptive models. Note the issue on Open World Assumption (ontologies) and CWA (prescriptive models).</p>

<p class="itemTitle">What is software semantics</p>
<p class="itemText">The purpose of this section is to explain software semantics as the "reciprocity between data and software code", and show that to some extent, set theory can replace the conceptualisation node.</p>
<p class="itemText">Conclude that the reciprocity between data and data processing code represents the smallest (atomic) semantic monolith.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Additionally, optionally, show:</p>
<p class="itemText">\begin{enumerate}</p>
<p class="itemText">\item the relationship with Grice's distinction in semantics as "what is said" and "pragmatic meaning": DONE</p>
<p class="itemText">\item OO as initial implementation to consolidate this reciprocity, and the class as implementation of the atomic semantic monolith; </p>
<p class="itemText">\end{enumerate}</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">\end{synopsis}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Explicit semantics</p>
<p class="itemText">The purpose of this section is to establish that for representing semantics, descriptive models (i.e., ontologies) trump prescriptive models (all 42010 models)</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Firstly, describe that formal semantics can to some extend take the role as conceptualisation, and hence using set theory as conceptualisation is the best option we have to address semantics. Consequently, show that semantic ambiguity then "only" follows from 4 construction issues (already presented in text below).</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Secondly, make the distinction between descriptive and prescriptive models [@Henderson-Sellers2012], and in [@Aßmann2006]: "Specification models focus on the specification, control, and generation of systems; ontologies focus on description and conceptualization (conceptual modelling) of things. Both kinds of models have in common the qualities of abstraction and causal connection."</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Second argument shows that (i) the trueness of a model is laid in reality, which is impossible to achieve, and that (ii) the next best we can achieve is establishing the correctness of a model against its conceptualisation node. Finally, observe that (iii) 4 issues will influence the correctness of the model. Then conclude that the best tool to control these issues are the logics from descriptive models (viz. ontologies) at the one hand, and its use as ontological commitment for the prescriptive models (viz. the 42010 models)</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Conclusions:</p>
<p class="itemText">\begin{enumerate}</p>
<p class="itemText">\item ontologies are more appropriate artefacts for conceptual models than system models</p>
<p class="itemText">\item as in [@Aßmann2006]: "Specification models focus on the specification, control, and generation of systems; ontologies focus on description and conceptualization (conceptual modelling) of things. Both kinds of models have in common the qualities of abstraction and causal connection."</p>

<p class="itemTitle">What is semantic interoperabiity</p>
<p class="itemText">\begin{enumerate}</p>
<p class="itemText">  \item Explain sIOP:</p>
<p class="itemText">  \begin{enumerate}</p>
<p class="itemText">    \item that consequence of data exchange = breaking the atomic semantic monolith = breaking the reciprocity by partitioning the data from its original code, and explain that standards are large semantic monoliths that roofs that point but are as manouverable as an oil tanker, and </p>
<p class="itemText">    \item that sIOP demands that despite this partitioning the reciprocity between the code of the receiving agent and the external data shall be re-installed.</p>
<p class="itemText">    \item Optionally, give a definition on phantom semantics</p>
<p class="itemText">  \end{enumerate}</p>
<p class="itemText">  \item We therefore need to extend the semantic coherence Principe into a sIOP coherence principle with a sIOP rational that the result of the semeiosis on receiving agent A’ does not conflict withthe outcome of the semeiosis on agent A: Without maintaining the reciprocity between binary code and the data it operates on, the semeiosis performed by software engineer A’ on the result of the data processing and their subsequent semantics cannot be guaranteed to be similar as intended by the software engineer.</p>
<p class="itemText">  \item Explain the difference with semantic standards which are basically large semantic monoliths</p>
<p class="itemText">  \item Introduce Principle: ontological commitment as minimal standard for sIOP, “(...) not in order to know *what there is*, but in order to know what a given remark or doctrine, ours or someone else’s, *says* there is” [@Quine:1953er]</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Expicit sIOP by alignments</p>
<p class="itemText">Thus:</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">\begin{enumerate}</p>
<p class="itemText">\item Follow the coherence principle and conclude that the models from which *external* data and *receiving* data processing code are derived, need to be brought into coherence with each other.</p>
<p class="itemText">\item The coherence principle already enforced a single unique reference for each agent. Re-installing coherence demands a semantic alignment between those single unique references. </p>
<p class="itemText">\item The purpose of that alignment is to establish how the truth of expressions that are formulated in terms of agent A, can be estabished by using formulations in terms of agent A' against the single unique reference from A'. </p>
<p class="itemText">\item The language that is used for expressing the alignment should be fit for its purpose. Refer to EDOAL [@Scharffe2011] as the currently most complete one.</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Roadway: Mediation</p>
<p class="itemText">Purpose of this section: Establish requirements for a *generic* mediator.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">With mediation we denote the process of transcribing a data term that originates from Agent A into a data term that matches a term familiair to Agent A', based on both agents' ontologies and the alignment between them. The main issue here is that although many different types of relation can be defined between the concepts of ontology A and A', e.g., superset of, a transcription of a token from A into a token from A' is a complete replacement and, hence, implements an equivalence relation. In [@Brandt2018b], we show a semantic valid transcription process. The requirements of a mediator are:</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">\begin{enumerate}</p>
<p class="itemText">\item Being a generic service</p>
<p class="itemText">\item Fully defined by two ontologies and their alignments</p>
<p class="itemText">\item Allows for semantic valid transcriptions only, where 'validity' refers to absence of inducing phantom semantics.</p>
<p class="itemText">\item Appropriate behaviour for non-translatable content, which should apply only as result of an incomplete alignment, a logical incorrect alignment, or attempts to communicate content that is considered irrelevant for the receiving agent.</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">sIOP Principles</p>
<p class="itemText">Purpose of this section: </p>
<p class="itemText">\begin{itemize}</p>
<p class="itemText">\item Show the semantic architecture as an additional layer that is orthogonal to current layers, expressing a separation of concerns between syntax and semantics (see [@Brandt:2013jh])</p>
<p class="itemText">\item Define loosely coupled semantics as a result of applying the 2 principles 'semantic separation of concerns' and 'semantic transparency' (see [@Brandt:2013jh])</p>
<p class="itemText">\item Repeat the Coherence Principle, the sIOP Coherence Principle, and the Ontological Commitment Principle, and show how they fit in the semantic architecture</p>
<p class="itemText">\item Better structure informal text below, towards more Principle definitions.</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">ISO42010 viewpoint on sIOP </p>
<p class="itemText">Consolidate the ideas on the bridgehead, spanning, roadway and principles into an additional ISO42010 Architectural Viewpoint (sIOP) that summarises all previous Sections as concerns on semantics and sIOP. ***Preferrably written by Eric.***</p>

<p class="itemText">\end{synopsis}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Related work</p>
<p class="itemText">Group the papers into 3 (?) categories, and discuss their strong and weak points in relation to sIOP and architecture in general, and our paper specifically.</p>

<li>
<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Discussion & future work</p>
<p class="itemText">Address shortcomings that we discover throughout writing the sections. </p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Conclude that by identifying a specific 42010 viewpoint on sIOP, a necessary condition towards the preparation of a sIOP capability in a software agent has been identified which can be applied to all MDE and view-based software architectures.</p>
