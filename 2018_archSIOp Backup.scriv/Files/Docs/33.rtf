\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24 Collaborating software components shall be able to establish equivalent abstractions of the state of affairs in their shared domain of application. Along the same lines and addressing local semantics, concerns exist about their maintainability and their ability to evolve, independently from collaborating peers and without exerting impact on peers to the greatest extent possible. No view-based architectural approaches provide support for these concerns, justifying an additional view(point) that we call the *Semantic View(point)*. \line We use Kruchten\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s 4+1 view model [@Kruchten1995], which underlies the IEEE standard 1471 [@IEEE2000;Maier2001], as reference architecture.\line \line }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24 > I would here refer to ISO 42010 (IEEE 1471) rather than Kruchten, as it is not limited to 4 views. Meaning you will be able to define an additional view according to the standard to cover the semantics concerns.}}
